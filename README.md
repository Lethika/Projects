 Human Health Monitoring System Using IOT Feb 2022 – Present 
Is a remote patient monitoring system to monitor on crucial bodily indicators such the ECG, EMG, and 
EEG. Where relevant data are gathered using sensors and IOT technology, and then further transferred to a 
remote server, processed, and then sent to the patient's device. In the event of an alert, the report is also 
sent to the doctor for review.

 Warehouse Monitoring System Oct 2022 – Nov 2022 
Utilizing CO2 sensors, temperature sensors, and humidity sensors for monitoring grain quality in a warehouse, 
established IOT technology. 


 Palliative Auto Feeder June 2022 – Present 
Enteral feeding is the method of choice for individuals with a functional gastrointestinal tract who are unable 
or unwilling to eat. They must be fed, and we ought to maintain a close eye on them on a routine basis. Hence, 
we are developing an automated feeding system for these ICU patients, automating it with IOT, to keeping an 
eye on the glucose level and to examining the prior presence of food in the body. Food presence in the body 
will be detected, and once parameter are achieved in human body, the feeder will be allowed to feed patients 
automatically.

 Air Quality Monitoring System Jan 2023 – Mar 2023 
Air quality monitoring systems in ports use sensors to detect toxic gases such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen 
oxide. If gas concentrations exceed a predetermined threshold, an alert is triggered, which can be sent to port 
workers and nearby communities via a notification system, allowing for timely evacuation and protection 
measures. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NKU0Z0PKZncyuKXDD2E56Azqqsn_7w8x/view?usp=drivesdk
 
 UI Design for Snow Kingdom Feb 2022 – Mar 2022 
 In this project, I used Figma for designing the UI design for VGP Snow Kingdom. The layout of the snow 
kingdom was designed, including the home page, attractions page, and payment page.
